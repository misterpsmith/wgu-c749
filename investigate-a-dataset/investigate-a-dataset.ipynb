    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen for this report is the \"Patient No-Shows for Medical Appointments\" dataset.  This dataset originated from the country of Brazil, and contains data on over one hundred thousand appointments.  It contains basic demographic data on the patients, as well as whether the patient received an SMS notification for their appointment, and whether the patient receiveda financial aid scholarship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created to study what factors were useful in predicting if patients would miss their appointments.  The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions to be explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the overall appointment no-show versus show rate?\n",
    "2. Do men or women have more no-shows?\n",
    "3. Does financial aid correlate with no-shows?\n",
    "4. Is age indicative of whether a patient will make their appointments?\n",
    "5. Do no-shows have a larger timeframe between schedule date and appointment date?\n",
    "6. Do some days of the week have more no-shows than others?\n",
    "7. Do SMS notifications coincide with fewer no-shows?\n",
    "8. Which neighborhoods have more no-shows than others?"
